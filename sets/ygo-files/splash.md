##Set Mechanics
There are a number of mechanics appearing in the unofficial Yu-Gi-Oh! x Magic the Gathering set. Some new and a couple returning mechanics, so lets look into them.

###Foretell
Foretell makes its comeback! If you have a card with foretell in your hand, you can pay {2} to hide it away in exile and cast it later.

###Take a risk
Wanna bet it all on red? Think you have what it takes to not go minus one? Then taking a risk is great for you! When a card says to take a risk, you discard a card from your hand, and look at the top card of your deck. If the top card happens to share a card type with the card you discarded, you can show off how your risk paid off and add it to your hand. Although you could say that either way you're winning, because some cards have bonuses if you take a risk regardless of whether it paid off or not.
